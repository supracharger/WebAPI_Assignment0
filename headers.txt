    Content-Type:               The file stucture type (json, csv ...) and character encoding. 
                                In this case it is json, and UTF-8.
    Vary:                       The response may vary from the 'Origin'.
    Vary:                       Like "Vary: Origin," but depends on "X-Origin". 
    Vary:                       Like "Vary: Origin," but depends on "Referer." Usually identifies
                                the page the request was from. 
    Content-Encoding:           The Compression formatting. In this case gzip. 
    Date:                       Timestamp of the servers response. 
    Server:                     The algorithm the server used for the response.
    X-XSS-Protection:           Disables the X-XXS-Protection for browsers.
    X-Frame-Options:            frames or iframes. "SAMEORIGIN" means the pages have to come 
                                from the same domain.
    X-Content-Type-Options:     Tells the server not to infer the content type. Helps prevent from
                                MIME-sniffing attacks.
    Alt-Svc:                    On port 443 can have alternate services for a specific amount of
                                time (2592000).
    Transfer-Encoding:          Instead of the data sent as a whole it is "chunked" to speed
                                up performance.
